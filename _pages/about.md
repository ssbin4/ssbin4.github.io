Hi, I am a second-year Ph.D student in computer science and engineering at <a href = "https://postech.ac.kr/"> POSTECH</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="http://namhoonlee.github.io">Namhoon Lee</a>.

My vision is to make machine learning models more accessible to everyone.
As of now, I am interested in building efficient models through compression and understanding generalization of large-scale neural networks.

Contact me via <a href="mailto:ssbin4@postech.ac.kr"> ssbin4@postech.ac.kr </a> if you have any questions.
